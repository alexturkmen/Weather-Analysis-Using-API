# python-api-challenge
1. In the first part of this assignment named WeatherPy, I am first creating a cities dataframe by making successive API calls on openweathermap. Then I am generating several scatter plots and linear regression graphs based on retrieved data to analyze the correlation between weather conditions and latitudes in both Northern and Southers Hemispheres.
2. In the second part named VacationPy, I am generating a list of preferred cities and then making successive calls on Google Places to create heatmap with closest hotels to the preferred cities marked on the map.
