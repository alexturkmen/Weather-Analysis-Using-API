# Notes
1. In WeatherPy, a cities dataframe is created by making successive API calls on openweathermap. Then, several scatter plots and linear regression graphs are generated based on retrieved data to analyze the correlation between weather conditions and latitudes in both Northern and Southers Hemispheres.
2. In VacationPy, first, a list of preferred cities are generated. Then, successive API calls are made on Google Places to create heatmap with closest hotels to the preferred cities which are marked on the map.
